## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

Grocify is fully mobile-responsive with:

* Hamburger menu animation
* Collapsible cart sidebar
* Adaptive layouts for all sections

Use browser DevTools or extensions like:

* **Responsive Viewer**
* **Device Mode (Chrome DevTools)**
  To test responsiveness on multiple screen sizes.

## 🧪 To Do (Enhancement Ideas)

* Add real product data with JS
* Implement add-to-cart functionality
* Integrate payment gateway
* Backend integration (e.g., Node.js, Laravel, etc.)
* Contact form with validation
* Use Tailwind JIT and local build instead of CDN for optimization
